WitherApocalypse
================

A plugin to be used for an "End of the World" event on a Bukkit Minecraft server.

Currently under development; current functionality:

* Players spawn with certain items (currently three 64-stacks of snowballs and some diamond armor)
* Players also get certain unlimited potion effects
* Snowballs turn into wither heads when thrown
* Wither heads explode with 10x the force of normal wither heads
* Players can "double-jump" by double-tapping space.
