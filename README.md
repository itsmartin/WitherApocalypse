WitherApocalypse
================

A plugin to be used for an "End of the World" event on a Bukkit Minecraft server. Currently very preliminary, under heavy development.

Current functionality:

* Start the "apocalypse" by either spawning a wither, or by typing the command ```/apocalypse``` (this toggles apocalypse on/off).
* When the apocalypse is underway, the sky darkens and endermen spawn (all biomes are changed to Sky).
* Players can "become withers" by drinking a "Potion of Withering" (a normal water bottle, renamed to *Potion of Withering* on an anvil).

When players become "withers", they get:
* Full diamond armor with blast protection IV
* A 64-stack of snowballs which turn into extra-powerful wither heads when thrown (10x the damage of normal wither heads)
* Potion effects - speed, jump boost, fire resistance and absorption
* The ability to "fly" by double-jumping

When withers are killed, they drop additional XP and more Potions of Withering. Killed wither-players respawn as normal players again.
